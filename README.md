<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a very eclectic reader, I want to be able to consult the books I want to rent by categories, so that I don't have to read description by description of the books until I find a book that I like.</li>
<li>As someone who loves synopses, I want to be able to read the description of books before I choose them, so I would have an idea of what they are about before I read them.</li>
<li>As a warehouse librarian, I want the system to be able to register new books and remove any books that I need, such as the availability query, so that I no longer need to use analogue or manual methods to do so.</li>
<li>As an attendant librarian, I want to be able to consult a book in a simple graphical interface, such as changing its availability status, quantity, etc., so that a rented book will not be available in the system.</li>
<li>As a manager of a library system, I want to be able to know who rented a book, what time, when it will have to be returned, contact number, address and fine, if any, all through a graphical interface as well, because that way I can have control of the integrity of books in general and for security purposes as well.</li>
<li>As an executive director of the project, I want the system to have a login screen, where given a specific login this user has specific permissions and rights, so that it is impossible for a user who wants to rent a book not to be able to register or delete a book for example, then messing with the system.</li>
